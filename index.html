            Let's start with a small story first:
            <br> I went to the University of Cartagena, something I had always wanted and always wanted to be the best, but I
            became very lazy and lost my time playing. The game was entertaining,<br> I had a good time playing with my classmates
            at the university. <Strike>But that game was shit fucking shitty rats, I hope you die all those shitty rats, use condoms
            do not leave offspring.<br></Strike> Thank you, they will make a better world.
